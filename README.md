## Overview

This project focuses on building a text generation model using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and Keras. The model is trained on a dataset of sequential text data, and once trained, it can generate new text based on a given seed sequence.

## Key Features

- **Data Processing:**
  - The project begins by reading a text file and tokenizing the text using the SpaCy library.
  - Sequences of tokens are created to serve as input-output pairs for training the LSTM model.

- **Model Architecture:**
  - The LSTM-based model is created using Keras with an Embedding layer, two LSTM layers, and Dense layers.
  - The model is trained using categorical cross-entropy loss and the Adam optimizer.

- **Training and Saving:**
  - The model is trained on a provided dataset, and the trained model is saved for later use.
  - The tokenizer used for encoding and decoding text is also saved to maintain consistency during text generation.

- **Text Generation:**
  - A function is implemented to generate new text given a seed sequence and the trained model.
  - This allows for the exploration of the model's creativity and ability to generate coherent text.

## Usage

- **Training:**
  - To train the model, use the provided training script. You may need to adjust parameters such as batch size, epochs, and model architecture based on your data and preferences.

- **Text Generation:**
  - Use the `generate_text` function by providing a seed text and the number of words you want to generate.
